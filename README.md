PersonalQR
==========

This web application is intended to show usersâ€™ profiles through QR codes. Profiles are customized by the own users, who decide which data they want to disclose and to whom.

It will be a secure way to share your personal information, accessible and user friendly.

####User demo:
```
User: personalqr
Pass: Manager01
```

USE
--------------
To fully use PersonalQR you must be registered, but unregistered users can also view other users' profiles through their QR codes.

> 1. Create a new user.
> 2. The website will send an e-mail with a link which must be opened for user activation.
> 3. Registered users can sign in by introducing their username and password.
> 4. Registered users may modify their personal information, add a photo or add their CV.
> 5. There are three levels of access to a user's information: all, registered users only, none (only that user).
> 6. You don't need to save your changes. They will automatically come into effect.
